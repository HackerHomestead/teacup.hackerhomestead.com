Install Hugo # Go to Hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture.\nSave it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.\nMore complete instructions are available at Install Hugo\nStep 2. Build the Docs # Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.\nFollow the following steps:\nClone the Hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313 Corresponding pseudo commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/spf13/hugo cd hugo /path/to/where/you/installed/hugo server --source=./docs \u0026gt; 29 pages created \u0026gt; 0 tags index created \u0026gt; in 27 ms \u0026gt; Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 \u0026gt; Press ctrl+c to stop Once you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten here, follow along the rest of this page on your local build.\nStep 3. Change the docs site # Stop the Hugo process by hitting Ctrl+C.\nNow we are going to run hugo again, but this time with hugo in watch mode.\n/path/to/hugo/from/step/1/hugo server --source=./docs --watch \u0026gt; 29 pages created \u0026gt; 0 tags index created \u0026gt; in 27 ms \u0026gt; Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 \u0026gt; Watching for changes in /Users/spf13/Code/hugo/docs/content \u0026gt; Press ctrl+c to stop Open your favorite editor and change one of the source content pages.

Unless otherwise specified, files are located at the same relative location as the url, in our case docs/content/overview/quickstart.md.\nChange and save this file.. Notice what happened in your terminal.\n\u0026gt; Change detected, rebuilding site \u0026gt; 29 pages created \u0026gt; 0 tags index created \u0026gt; in 26 ms Refresh the browser and observe that the typo is now fixed.\nNotice how quick that was. Try to refresh the site before it\u0026rsquo;s finished building. I double dare you. Having nearly instant feedback enables you to have your creativity flow without waiting for long builds.\nStep 4.
