# Packaging the file system

Espesally for a flash based target, you need to take your rootfs and create a filesystem image that can be burned onto the flash NOR memory of the device (teacup).

## Squashfs packaging

```
mksquashfs 
	rootfs[add input file] 
	rootfs.squashfs[output file name] 
	-comp xz
```

## jffs2 packaging

```
mkfs.jffs2 
	-o jffs2.img[output file name] 
	-r jffs2_dir[input folder ] 
	-e 0x8000[eraseSize 32K] 
	-s 0x40000[page size 256K] 
	-n -l 
	-X zlib 
	--pad=0x300000[output image pad to3MB size]
```

It is recommended to create the jiff2 partition by erasing the device and then directly mounting it. The specific operation is as follows;

1. Compile the contents of uboot, uImage and rootfs correctly
1. Its programming method erases all norflash
1. Finally burn to the corresponding position. (See 2.3.1.1 Norflash Burning for details)

After the system is up, manually mount according to the uboot partition information, 

for example: `mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock3 /system` then copy the corresponding files to the `/system` folder though the SD card.

Finally, copy it out by `dd if=/dev/mtd3 of=/tmp/system.jffs2` to complete the production.

Note: jffs2 makes a cerain partition as jffs2 file, and the size of the partition must be an integer multiple of nor erase_size, which is the offcial driver's requirement.
