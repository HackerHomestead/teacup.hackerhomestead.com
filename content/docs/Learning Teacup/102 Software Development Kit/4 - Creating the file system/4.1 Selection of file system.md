# Selection of file system

For NOR flash based systems, the storage space is generally small, so the compressed file system is selected. jae-jun

The postive platform recommends the following two file systems

- **squashfs**: ready-only filesystem with high compression
- **jffs2**: reable and writable filesystem with optional compression mode.

The modifed system partition adopts suashfs, and jffs2 is used for configuration partitions and other partitions that require frequent reading and writing.

In addition, the file system has two choices: glibc and uclibc. The characteristic of glibc is that it supports comprehensive functions, but takes up a little more stroage; the characteristic of uclibc is that it takes up less storage space than glibc, but supports slightly less functions than glibc. Developers should choose the appropriate libc method according to their actual situation.

For general application secenarios, customers are recommended to use uclibc to build the system.
