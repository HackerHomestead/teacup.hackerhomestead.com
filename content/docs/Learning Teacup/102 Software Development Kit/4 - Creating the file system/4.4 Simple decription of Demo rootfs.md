# Partitioning recomendations

The Demo partitioning method of ISVP is as follows:
- u-boot: 256K
- uImage: 2660K
- rootfs: 2048K
- system: 3328K

In the file system of ISVP, there are two specified file paths:
- `/etc/sensor/` - Stores the bin file of the Sensor in this directory
- `/etc/webrtc_profile.ini` - Different echo cancellation parameter files

The product may be different from the above two places, and the relevant parameter files may also be updated when the product is upgraded, so it is recommended to softly link the above two places to a path that can be read, written or updated.

After the rootfs of Demo is started, it will detect whether the system partition is available, if not, it will be formatted and the relevant directory structure will be created. Therefore, for the first demo system, you can erase the entire Flash, and burn u-boot, uImage, rootfs; the system partition will be created automatically.

The structure of the system partition is as follows:

{{< hint danger >}}
Yah in the automated translation this was so bad I am going to have to come back to it
{{< /hint >}}

Demo rootfs can be used as a reference, and developers can define the rootfs solution according to the actual situation of the product.
