# Busybox

BusyBox is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file. It runs in a variety of POSIX environments such as Linux, ...

## Busybox compilation
Similar to the kernel compilation method, you need to `make defconfig` first and then `make`, and then `make install` will generate the installation files in the `busybox/_install` directory by default.
```
make isvp_glibc_defconfig
make
make install
```
each configuration description:
```
isvp_glibc_defconfig --glibc default config
isvp_glibc_mini_defconfig --glibc default clipping config
isvp_uclibc_defconfig --uclibc default config
isvp_uclibc_mini_defconfig --uclibc default clipping config
```
