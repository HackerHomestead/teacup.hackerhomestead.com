# Considerations when Compiling an Application

1. For distinction between glibc and uclibc compilation, please refer to "Toolchain Instrcutions"
1. Regarding the link sequence of API libraries: [IVS library] [mxu library] [libimp / libsysutils] [libalog]
1. Because libimp relies on C++ library, you need to use mips-linux-gnu-g++ to link. If you use gcc to link, you need to manually add `LD_FLAGS+=stdc++
1. How to optimize the size of the elf file
	- Select O2 for compilation level: `CFLAGS/CXX_FLAGS += -O2`
	- `DFLAG += -WI,-gcsections` do not link unnecessary sections.
	- The elf file implements mips-linux-gnu-strip, and deletes unnecessary segments ager linking.
1. If there are multiple elf files in the system that need to be linked to the library file, you can use the dynamic link method. If there is only one file to link the library file, please use the static link method (Note, libimp related functions can only exist in one copy in the system instance). Selecting the dynamic link method during debugging can facilitate debugging and problem feedback.
